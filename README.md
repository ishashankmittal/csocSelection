An Express app with Passport Authentication
So i have created the backend part of a social media app. 
first you can sign up and then sign in. 

On sign up, credentials are stored in MongoDb and a session id is created.

Then you can sign in to view the user profile containing the user details. 

then the sign out button returns to the home page. 

I haven't done much of the frontend. but the backend part is almost complete. 

first run "npm i" 

then "nodemon index.js" 

the app runs on port 3000
